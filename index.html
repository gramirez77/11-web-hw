                    Maurits Cornelis Escher (17 June 1898 – 27 March 1972) was a Dutch graphic artist 
                    who made mathematically-inspired woodcuts, lithographs, and mezzotints. Despite 
                    wide popular interest, Escher was for long somewhat neglected in the art world, 
                    even in his native Netherlands. He was 70 before a retrospective exhibition was held. 
                    In the twenty-first century, he became more widely appreciated, with exhibitions across the world.

                    His work features mathematical objects and operations including impossible objects, 
                    explorations of infinity, reflection, symmetry, perspective, truncated and stellated 
                    polyhedra, hyperbolic geometry, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation">tessellations</a>. 
                    Although Escher believed he had no mathematical ability, he interacted with the mathematicians 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P%C3%B3lya">George Pólya</a>,

                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Haag">Friedrich Haag</a>, and 
                    conducted his own research into tessellation.

                    Early in his career, he drew inspiration from nature, making studies of insects, 
                    landscapes, and plants such as lichens, all of which he used as details in his artworks. 
                    He traveled in Italy and Spain, sketching buildings, townscapes, architecture and 
                    the tilings of the Alhambra and the Mezquita of Cordoba, and became steadily more 
                    interested in their mathematical structure.

                <p>
                    Escher's art became well known among scientists and mathematicians, and in popular 
                    culture, especially after it was featured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner">
                    Martin Gardner</a> in his April 1966 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American. 
                    Apart from being used in a variety of technical papers, his work has appeared on the 
                    covers of many books and albums. He was one of the major inspirations of Douglas 
                    Hofstadter's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1979 book
