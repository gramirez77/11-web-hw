                <p>
                    Maurits Cornelis Escher was born on 17 June 1898 in Leeuwarden, Friesland, the Netherlands, 
                    in a house that forms part of the Princessehof Ceramics Museum today. He was the youngest son 
                    of the civil engineer George Arnold Escher and his second wife, Sara Gleichman. In 1903, the 
                    family moved to Arnhem, where he attended primary and secondary school until 1918. Known to 
                    his friends and family as "Mauk", he was a sickly child and was placed in a special school at 
                    the age of seven; he failed the second grade. Although he excelled at drawing, his grades were 
                    generally poor. He took carpentry and piano lessons until he was thirteen years old.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1918, he went to the Technical College of Delft. From 1919 to 1922, Escher attended the Haarlem 
                    School of Architecture and Decorative Arts, learning drawing and the art of making woodcuts. 
                    He briefly studied architecture, but he failed a number of subjects (due partly to a persistent 
                    skin infection) and switched to decorative arts, studying under the graphic artist Samuel Jessurun 
                    de Mesquita.

                <p>
                    Moorish tessellations including this one at the Alhambra inspired Escher's work with tilings of 
                    the plane. He made sketches of this and other Alhambra patterns in 1936.

                <h2 class="display-6">Study Journeys</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1922, an important year of his life, Escher traveled through Italy, visiting Florence, 
                    San Gimignano, Volterra, Siena, and Ravello. In the same year, he traveled through Spain, 
                    visiting Madrid, Toledo, and Granada. He was impressed by the Italian countryside and, in 
                    Granada, by the Moorish architecture of the fourteenth-century Alhambra. The intricate 
                    decorative designs of the Alhambra, based on geometrical symmetries featuring interlocking 
                    repetitive patterns in the coloured tiles or sculpted into the walls and ceilings, triggered 
                    his interest in the mathematics of tessellation and became a powerful influence on his work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Escher returned to Italy and lived in Rome from 1923 to 1935. While in Italy, Escher met 
                    Jetta Umiker – a Swiss woman, like himself attracted to Italy – whom he married in 1924. 
                    The couple settled in Rome where their first son, Giorgio (George) Arnaldo Escher, named 
                    after his grandfather, was born. Escher and Jetta later had two more sons – Arthur and Jan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He travelled frequently, visiting (among other places) Viterbo in 1926, the Abruzzi in 1927 
                    and 1929, Corsica in 1928 and 1933, Calabria in 1930, the Amalfi coast in 1931 and 1934, and 
                    Gargano and Sicily in 1932 and 1935. The townscapes and landscapes of these places feature 
                    prominently in his artworks. In May and June 1936, Escher travelled back to Spain, revisiting 
                    the Alhambra and spending days at a time making detailed drawings of its mosaic patterns. 
                    It was here that he became fascinated, to the point of obsession, with tessellation, explaining:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>It remains an extremely absorbing activity, a real mania to which I have become addicted, 
                    and from which I sometimes find it hard to tear myself away</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sketches he made in the Alhambra formed a major source for his work from that time on. 
                    He also studied the architecture of the Mezquita, the Moorish mosque of Cordoba. This turned 
                    out to be the last of his long study journeys; after 1937, his artworks were created in his 
                    studio rather than in the field. His art correspondingly changed sharply from being mainly 
                    observational, with a strong emphasis on the realistic details of things seen in nature and 
                    architecture, to being the product of his geometric analysis and his visual imagination. 
                    All the same, even his early work already shows his interest in the nature of space, the 
                    unusual, perspective, and multiple points of view.

                <h2 class="display-6">Later Life</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1935, the political climate in Italy (under Mussolini) became unacceptable to Escher. He had 
                    no interest in politics, finding it impossible to involve himself with any ideals other than the 
                    expressions of his own concepts through his own particular medium, but he was averse to fanaticism 
                    and hypocrisy. When his eldest son, George, was forced at the age of nine to wear a Balilla uniform 
                    in school, the family left Italy and moved to Château-d'Œx, Switzerland, where they remained for 
                    two years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Netherlands post office had Escher design a semi-postal stamp for the "Air Fund" in 1935, and 
                    again in 1949 he designed Netherlands stamps. These were for the 75th anniversary of the Universal 
                    Postal Union; a different design was used by Surinam and the Netherlands Antilles for the same 
                    commemoration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Escher, who had been very fond of and inspired by the landscapes in Italy, was decidedly unhappy 
                    in Switzerland. In 1937, the family moved again, to Uccle (Ukkel), a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. 
                    World War II forced them to move in January 1941, this time to Baarn, Netherlands, where Escher 
                    lived until 1970. Most of Escher's best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, 
                    cold, and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work. After 1953, 
                    Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after 
                    an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time, but the illustrations and text for the 
                    lectures were later published as part of the book Escher on Escher. He was awarded the Knighthood 
                    of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1955; he was later made an Officer in 1967.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In July 1969 he finished his last work, a large woodcut with threefold rotational symmetry called 
                    Snakes, in which snakes wind through a pattern of linked rings. These shrink to infinity toward 
                    both the center and the edge of a circle. It was exceptionally elaborate, being printed using 
                    three blocks, each rotated three times about the center of the image and precisely aligned to 
                    avoid gaps and overlaps, for a total of nine print operations for each finished print. The image 
                    encapsulates Escher's love of symmetry; of interlocking patterns; and, at the end of his life, 
                    of his approach to infinity. The care that Escher took in creating and printing this woodcut 
                    can be seen in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmLaM6NkTDs">video recording</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Escher moved to the Rosa Spier Huis in Laren in 1970, an artists' retirement home in which he had 
                    his own studio. He died in a hospital in Hilversum on 27 March 1972, aged 73. He is buried at the 
                    New Cemetery in Baarn.
